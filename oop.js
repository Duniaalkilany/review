//a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. ... Each row in a table could be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key, and rows among multiple tables can be made related using foreign keys.
//sQL is a programming language that is used by most relational database management systems (RDBMS) to manage data stored in tabular form (i.e. tables). A relational database consists of multiple tables that relate to each other. The relation between tables is formed in the sense of shared columns

/*
procedural programming
1.programe devided into variables and functions 
2.overloading is not possible 
3.hiding data not possible
4.data is sepearated

OOP:
1.program devided into obj+methods
2.overloading is possible  
3.hiding data is possible
4.data not sepearated (in one location)===> i have class (have all probarties and all methods )
*/

/*why OOP:
1.large and complex software architecture in organized way 
2.create reusable objects to use in application easily with inheritance 
*/
/*
1.class /object
2.object methods
3.instantiation
4.prototype
5.inheritance
